# predictability-of-human-mobility
Calculate the predictability of discrete time series based on LZ entropy estimator

In numerical_simulations, case_study/deterministic/exploration/markovian_process scripts are the experiments in the paper.

Simple calculation of predictability is in simplified_version.
